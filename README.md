# capture-the-money
This game is capture the money.
The rules of the game are simply that the player who collects the most money wins the game. Two players cannot overlap and are not allowed off the board.
I used 4 functions in this project. These are initializeBoard, displayBoard, hasCapturedMoney, and movePlayer.
Firstly, initializeBoard function is for printing the board for game.
Another function, displayBoard function is for showing the board that has a print.
hasCapturedMnoney function is for ending the game when all money on the board have been collected.
The last function is movePlayer. This is for players can go in the board with spesific rules.
Enjoy this game :)
